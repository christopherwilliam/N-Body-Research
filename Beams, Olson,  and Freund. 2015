A FINITE ELEMENT BASED P3M METHOD FOR N-BODY PROBLEMS
  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.08509.pdf
This paper clearly describes current methods for N-Body simulations. 
Four basic steps of P3M methods
  1. assignment of charges to the mesh
  2. solving for the smooth potential on the mesh
  3. transferring the potential back to the charge locations
  4. calculating the point-to-point (short-range) interactions
